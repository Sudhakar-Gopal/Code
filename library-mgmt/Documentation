Postgre SQL is used here for DB. Since Postgres is fully ACID compliant and able to handle large volume of transactions. Also can handle simultaneous borrow and return without conflicts

I have use Global Exception Handler as AOP Advice inorder separte exception handling from business logic

Assumptions 

1) If book is already borrowed, then cannot borrow same book
2) Book with same Isbn, must have same author, title
3) If book is not borrowed, then return of the book is considered invalid
4) While return, borrower ID should match with the one already tagged under the book
